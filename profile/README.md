# Hello there!
Welcome to the GDPS Hub Team GitHub organization, here you can find some open source code from our products, that we've been developing for the past 2 years. We may not publish everything, but for sure there's something here to sneak ðŸ‘€.

We generally don't allow pull requests or issues as we don't usually allow code modifications or suggestions, but if you wanna do some hard code work with us, make sure to visit <a href="https://gdpshub.com/jobs">our applications page</a> and check for something you want to help us!

For any inquiry, make sure to email us at <a href="mailto:gdpshub@gmail.com">gdpshub@gmail.com</a> or visit our Discord server. Further information about comms on <a href="https://gdpshub.com/legal">gdpshub.com/legal</a>.
